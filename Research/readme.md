The Game is treated as a Zero Sum Differential Game, and solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation gives us the value function. This value function for these games is
usually the closest distance the evaders can reach to the goal, before being captured by the pursuers. We are trying to map pursuer coalitions to evaders, with these
value functions as the weight.
