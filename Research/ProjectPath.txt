Here is how the project will proceed.
1. First come up with an algorithm to incorporate Value function based weighted matching to the paper you have read.
2. Use RL to come up with a way to find value functions for n evaders vs 1 pursuer games.
3. Once you have all this, try to find matching for m pursuers vs n evaders with m < n. The current paper, does not even look at this case, or it simply assumes they cannot be caught. See if its possible to do that.
