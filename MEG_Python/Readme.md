# Introduction
This is a python implementation of the following repo [MEG](https://github.com/abinashagasti/Multiplayer_Reach_Avoid/tree/master/MEG). 
I have also documented it [here](https://github.com/Prajwal-Vijay/Pursuer_Evader_Games/blob/main/MEG_Python/MEGDocumentation.pdf).

Here we solve scenarios of single pursuer vs n evaders.
